 · She cheated so she's out. Who cares if she cries herself to sleep?! She obviously has someone else to comfort her. If you let her weasel her way back into your life, not only will you appear weak by not sticking to your word but you'll essentially tell her it's ok to treat you any way she pleases. Why? Because you'll take her back no matter what. My wife has cheated and lied to me repeatedly throughout our relationship; My wife has cheated and lied to me repeatedly throughout our relationship. I caught my wife in an affair 7 years ago. I walked into our room and she had not closed out her last Internet session. When I pulled up the web, there it was pictures, letters, etc. Even after 3 1/2 years, over 2 years divorced, this topic still enrages me. I was the betrayed and did not want divorce, she filed for divorce 2 months after discovery. She is still with her affair partner, his marriage ended in divorce as well. Every time she contacts me or thoughts of her come up, I get angry.
