¬†¬∑ This question might have been asked and solved, but the problem is that the most anti fly scripts always are identifying in a time when they are not touching a floor. The problem is that I have some tools which let you fly or give you a high jump power, and those anti fly scripts could ban those players. So the main question is how do I ban hackers when they are flying in . Usually, if you exploit in a Roblox game, you shouldn't be banned from Roblox, just from the game. If you exploit a bug in the Roblox website, however, such as a way for free robux or free skins, you will most likely get your account banned. 64 views View upvotes Related Answer Hunk Answered Jan 1, I got banned today on Roblox for 7 days.
