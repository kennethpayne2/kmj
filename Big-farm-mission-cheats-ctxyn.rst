Firstly, there are no cheats that work for Big Farm. Anyone who tells you that they are cheating or has a working cheat is simply either trolling you or trying to steal your account. If you actually have proof that someone is cheating then you should send it to support who will investigate. Cowshed – This is where you can produce milk and dung using cow feeds (Requires 10). Cherry orchard – This is where you can produce cherries and fallen leaves using fertilizers (Requires 30). Windmill – This is where you can produce different feeds. . You can get nice rewards Also, if you like to be in a ranking, there are seperate mission rankings only for playing that content of our game. And very soon you will be able to use a brand new feature in Big Farm that heavily relies on missions. So, there is a lot of incentive if you're up to the challenge Greetings, Timo.
