I thought it was pretty easy besides how much optimization needed to be done for the last problem to pass all test cases. Edit: LC easy, LC Med/Hard(leaning towards hard bc of a few finicky test cases), LC Hard(prob hardest I’ve seen on hackerrank besides Atlassian which I got completely destroyed by). We would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow  more.  · I interviewed at Roblox in Jan Interview. The first round was an online assessment on Hacker Ranks. Total 3 questions for hr. The questions were all medium Leetcode questions. Not too hard. One question I got was exactly the same as the one in Leetcode (look for Roblox tag). The 2nd one was similar but still different.
