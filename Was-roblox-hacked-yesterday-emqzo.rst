 · Everyone was scared to play Roblox games but did it really get hacked?🔻SUBSCRIBE! ! IMPORTANT!  · Roblox only issued a single statement yesterday on Twitter, saying they “believe” they have identified “an” underlying cause of the outage. that this is Is Accessible For Free: False. Roblox does not support and can not enforce or recover inventory for players making deals for items or currency outside of our official systems. You should never make a trade or purchase outside the system because the other person could trick you and back out. You can read more about Player Trading Scams.
