Help Talking Tom convince Talking Angela he’s the right cat for her by talking to her, giving her gifts and singing to her. If you watch closely, you’ll see Ginger, trying to mess up Tom’s plans. Have an intelligent conversation with Angela (English only) and enjoy her witty and funny answers for hours and hours. Meet her friends – a kind cat and noisy puppy and take photos together. And you can always speak with her. Talking Angela responds to your every word. Say something, wait a little and listen to her hilarious voice. Spend time having fun with this function and hold a whole conversation with her. Talking Angela is a chatterbot app developed by Slovenian studio Outfit7 as part of the Talking Tom and Friends series. It was released on Novem and January for iPhone and iPod and iPad, January for Android, and January for Google Play. The app's successor, the My Talking Angela app was released in December
